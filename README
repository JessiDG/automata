Cellular automata are mathametical models with simple instructions for creation and destruction. This particular one is inspired by Conway's Game of Life.

The code reacts to a "rule", a number (in this case from 0-255) that tells it how to replicate two given characters. 

How to play with this:
- Many numbers will produce boring patterns, but some are Ugly-Christmas-Sweater-Lovely (my rule numbers are 150, 182, and 60). 
- Look for more rule options here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html
