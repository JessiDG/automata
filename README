This assignment asked us to create a cellular automata, sometimes called the game of life (Conway) and is a bit of an baby version of machine learning, where the code reacts to itself. Feel free to experiment with different numbers to see different patterns. My favorites are 150, 182, and 60. Look for more rule options here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html
